# Compiling
Only Windows is supported for now, though the CMake infrastructure is intended to ease the development of cross-platform code (for whoever decides to work on that).

## Windows/CMake
You'll need:
- Visual Studio (for the compiler, CMake, Ninja and vcpkg)

In order for the compiler to work, you'll need to be in a VS developer environment. Then, simply use the provided `vcpkg-win64-x86` preset to compile and build. If you want to change any settings, do so on the command line or via `CMakeUserPresets.json`.
```sh
cmake --preset vcpkg-win64-x86
cmake --build build
```

The core VCR tests are integrated with CMake, so running the tests is easy:
```sh
ctest --test-dir build
```

Presets have been provided for building and testing. These are intended for IDEs, so that they can properly autodetect things. Feel free to contribute IDE launch settings as appropriate.

### Visual Studio Code + CMake Tools
You'll need to enable `"cmake.useVsDeveloperEnvironment": "always"` in your workspace settings to convince CMake Tools to set up a VS developer environment.

## CMake Options
| OPTION                    | DESCRIPTION                                                           |
|:-------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MUPEN64RR_USE_SANITIZER` | Specifies a sanitizer to compile with. [`{OFF, ASAN}`, default `OFF`] |

### CLion

Make sure to set the CMake profile to use the `vcpkg-win64-x86` preset, enabling it if needed.

If you aren't presented with a CMake profile selection dialog on startup, you can change the active profile by going to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> CMake`.

# Commit Style

Merge commits to the `main` branch *must* adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification). 

---

Non-merge commits to the `main` branch *shouldn't* use the Conventional Commits spec.

This is to avoid polluting the final release changelog with commits that, for example, only fix bugs generated by merging PRs.

The exception to this rule are commit types that [wouldn't be included in the changelog anyway](https://github.com/mupen64/mupen64-rr-lua/blob/master/cliff.toml#L63).

---

Commits made on other branches don't have to adhere to any specific commit style.

Example commits:

```
fix(VCR): fix crash when playing a movie while holding B
```

```
feat(ConfigDialog): add plugin config API
```

# Program Structure

Mupen64 is currently divided into two parts: its Core, and its Windows GUI.

## <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa3b86d8-6bcf-4b65-a575-4ea2930a516c" width="64" align="center"/> Core 

The core implements emulation functionality and defines an API which allows it to be driven externally.

The Win32 implementation of a Mupen64 GUI.

# Reading and using Crashlogs

If you have a `mupen.dmp`, open it in WinDbg and run `!analyze-v`.

If you only have the stacktrace from `mupen.log`:

1. Identify the faulting address
2. Open x32dbg
3. Open the "Go to" dialog by pressing Ctrl + G
4. Navigate to `0x00400000` + `[Your Address]`

# Code Style

Code formatting must abide by the [.clang-format](https://github.com/mkdasher/mupen64-rr-lua-/blob/master/.clang-format) file provided in the repository root.
Failure to comply will fail the check-format workflow.

# Plugin Guidelines

- Give your plugin a descriptive name.
    1. The filename should be formatted as follows: `[Plugin Name]-[x86|x64]-[debug|release].dll`
        a. e.g.: `TASInput-x86-release.dll` 
    2. The friendly name should be formatted as follows: `[Plugin Name] [Version] [x86|x64] [Debug]`
        a. e.g.: `TASInput 2.0.0 x86`, `TASInput 2.0.0 x86 Debug`
- Do as little initialization work in `DllMain` as possible. Do it all in `RomOpen` and cache the results.
    1. Watch out for implicit COM initialization through DirectInput!
- Write persistent config to the registry, not the filesystem.
    1. Play fair, don't pollute the user's Mupen directory if possible.

# Pre-Merge and Release Checklist

Before merging a pull request into main or pushing out a release, verify that:

1. The code is formatted according to the .clang-format file
2. All tests pass
3. The code is architecturally sound
4. Unicode-containing filesystem paths are consumed correctly
5. The wiki has been updated with any relevant changes
6. The plugin API is backwards-compatible *(unless otherwise specified)*
